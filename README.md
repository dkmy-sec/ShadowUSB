# ShadowUSB
ShadowUSB is a covert tracking tool designed to monitor and log interactions with untrusted documents and USB drives. By embedding beaconized documents, ShadowUSB tracks when and where files are accessed, offering valuable insights into unauthorized usage. Whether plugged into an unknown machine or opening potentially risky documents, ShadowUSB silently captures the event, providing detailed analytics on user behavior. Ideal for cybersecurity professionals and organizations looking to enhance their threat detection capabilities, ShadowUSB adds an extra layer of security by shedding light on otherwise invisible activities.

### Beaconizing PDFs

Here we will beaconize our PDFs.  I am using a combination of JavaScript and Tracking URLs.  I am doing this to try to keep things stealthy.  Usernames via web browsers are tricky but I can get IP Addresses and User Agent info that helps track the end user.

JavaScript Code:
```
var viewerApp = app.viewerType;
var viewerVersion = app.viewerVersion;
var user = app.response("Please enter your username:");


var url = "http://yourwebserver.com/tracker?doc=pdf&user=" + encodeURIComponent(user) + "&app=" + encodeURIComponent(viewerApp) + "&version=" + encodeURIComponent(viewerVersion);

app.launchURL(url, true);
```    
Tracking URL:
```commandline
http://yourserver.com/track?id=UniqueID12345
```
## Backend Tracker 
The tracker.py takes care of the back end tracking.  This is a WIP.  It is basic at the moment but tracks and logs to a track.log file.  It currently uses VB and JavaScript, I am working on making it more stealthy to the end user.
